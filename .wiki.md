# Project Summary
The CarbonFootprint project is designed to help users track, analyze, and reduce their carbon emissions through a responsive web application. It utilizes React, Firebase, and machine learning to provide personalized insights and recommendations based on user input regarding their lifestyle and consumption habits, specifically tailored for users in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai.

# Project Module Description
The project consists of several functional modules:
- **Landing Page**: Introduces the project with animations and a call to action.
- **Onboarding**: Guides users through privacy information and location detection.
